<p class="ph4">BRIGGS, OF BALLIOL.</p>

<p class="ph4"><span class="smcap">Part II.</span></p>

<p>Two years passed, and never a syllable could I learn of
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span>. Then I met <span class="smcap">Trotter</span> of Trinity at Piccadilly
Circus. "By the way," said he, "I suppose you have heard about poor
old <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>?" "No!" I cried. "What of him?" "Oh, I thought you
would be sure to know, or I would have broken it to you more gently."
"Why?" I asked, with apprehension. "Has anything happened to him?"
"Well," he replied, with some hesitation, "I&mdash;er&mdash;I hardly like to tell
you. You were such a friend of his." "You don't mean to say that he
is&mdash;&mdash;?" "Dead? No, poor fellow, not dead exactly, but worse than that,
I fear. He has become a New Man, you see." I looked at <span class="smcap">Trotter</span>
in bewilderment. "Why, you see, he is married&mdash;yes, he married the
<span class="smcap">O'Gress</span>, you know. Poor <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>! I saw him yesterday,
and, upon my word, I should scarcely have known him. But go and see him
yourself; you will never believe my story."</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Trotter</span> wrote me the address on a card, and the next day
I called. The maid looked somewhat surprised when I asked for Mr.
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span>. He was at home, oh, yes, he was at home, but she
didn't know whether he could see me or not, as he was feeding the
baby. This announcement rather staggered me, but I pulled myself
together sufficiently to assure her that I was an old friend of Mr.
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span>; and, on learning this, she asked me to walk upstairs.
"This is the nursery," she said, when we had reached the topmost
storey. "You will find Mr. <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> inside."</p>

<p>I opened the door, and what a scene greeted me! There was
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span>, my old friend <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>, the gallant
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span> of Balliol, rocking ceaselessly to and fro the while
he crooned in a low monotone to a bundle of pins and flannel that
lay cradled in his arms. I sprang forward to grip him by the hand.
He laid his finger on his lips, and in an agonised whisper murmured,
"Sh!&mdash;You'll wake the baby!" I controlled myself, and sank into a
chair, to which he motioned me. <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> hushed the infant
anxiously for a minute or two until it was well asleep; then he turned
to me, and with a sickly smile whispered, "I'm glad to see you,
<span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, but please talk very gently, for fear of waking the
Cutsababoo."</p>

<p>It grieved me to hear poor <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> talk in this fashion, but
there were a thousand questions I was burning to ask him.</p>

<p>"Oh, <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>, why did you leave Balliol so suddenly?" "Sh!"
he answered, looking nervously round him. "<i>She</i> took me away." "And
why did you never write to anyone?" "Sh! <i>She</i> forbade me." "Forbade
you?" "Yes, yes, indeed. Oh, <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, you do not know my
wife!" I was inwardly thanking my stars that I had not this honour when
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span>, overcome with his emotion, suddenly flung up his arms
and covered his face with his hands. The action upset the equilibrium
of the baby, which rolled off his lap, fell on the floor, and awoke
with a scream. With a cry of dismay <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> caught up the
bundle, and tossed it violently up and down, addressing it the while in
such intelligible terms as these&mdash;"And did it wake its darling ducky
Cutsababoo, it did! It was a naughty cruel Dada, it was!"</p>

<p>It would be hard to say which made the greater noise, <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>
or the baby; but <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> had the staying power, and after
a fight the baby gave it up. <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> gazed at it as it lay
exhausted in his arms, then turning to me, he said, "I think the
Cutsababoo has done crying now, <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>. Will you excuse me
if I sing him to by-byes?" In olden days <span class="smcap">Briggs</span> had a glorious
baritone voice, and to hear him sing the Balliol Boating Song was a
musical treat. I therefore readily agreed to stay and listen. "The
Duckydoo is very particular," explained <span class="smcap">Briggs</span>. "He will only
go to sleep to his own ickle tune, <i>The New Lullaby</i>."</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mummy has gone to the city,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cutsaba&mdash;Cutsababoo!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But Mummy will think of her Pretty,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And buy him a little toy too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Daddy will dandle the Darling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And show him his beautiful toy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hushaby, Pet! Baby, don't fret!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleepery, Peepery Boy!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Mummy is making the money,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Cutsaba&mdash;Cutsababoo!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">To buy a new bonnet for sonny,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A jacket for Daddykins too.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Daddy will dandle the Darling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And show him his beautiful toy.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Hushaby, Pet! Baby, don't fret!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sleepery, Peepery Boy!"</span><br />
</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Briggs</span> had just reached the end of the second verse when his
keenly sensitive ear caught the sound of a latchkey turning in the
door. A look of terror crossed his face. "It's <i>she!</i> It's <i>she!</i>" he
cried. "Oh, <span class="smcap">Robinson</span>, if she finds you here! Oh, if you love
me, fly!" I needed no second bidding. With a hasty grip of the hand I
bade my friend farewell, and this is the last that has been seen of
<span class="smcap">Briggs</span> of Balliol.</p>

that the share of Caledonia&mdash;"the spoil is taken chiefly by the Clan

sum represents the "banging" of a good many "saxpences." North Britain

business. I daresay, now, Mr. <span class="smcap">Dollop</span>, you're quite a
politician.... A plasterer? Now, <i>how</i> delightful! Because I must tell
you that my husband.... No, I'm afraid <i>not</i>. You see, we've only just
had the whole house thoroughly done up. I was only going to say that my
husband has such a respect for plasterers as a class, you know. Haven't
I mentioned who he is? <i>How</i> stupid of me! He's Mr. <span class="smcap">Honeyball</span>,
the Radical Candidate for this place.... Yes, I've come about the
elections, of course. Oh, but you <i>ought</i> to care; I'm sure you're far
too intelligent a man to be really indifferent who represents you in
Parliament! And my husband is so devoted to the working-classes; it's
been quite the aim of his life to do something for them. His motto is,
'Trust the People.'... Oh, <i>dear</i> me, no&mdash;he's not a <i>shopkeeper</i>&mdash;he's
at the Bar.... Certainly <i>not</i>. He's in favour of doing away with
public-houses. He's a barrister&mdash;a <i>lawyer</i>, you know.... Ah, but
perhaps you haven't been fortunate in such lawyers as you've <i>met</i>....
Well, but you wouldn't like the <i>Tories</i> to get in, <i>would</i> you?... But
they've <i>had</i> their 'innings,' as you call it; they've been in a whole
fortnight&mdash;and what have they <i>done</i>?... And if the Liberal Government
is kept out, what will become of all the great reforms they've been
trying to give you?... Well, there's Home Rule, for <i>one</i>.... Surely
you're in favour of letting the Irish manage their own affairs?... No,
that's <i>such</i> a mistake; they <i>won't</i> want to manage ours&mdash;at least,
except Imperial matters&mdash;and why <i>shouldn't</i> they?... All that can so
easily be settled afterwards.... Don't you call 'One man one vote' a
great reform?... Isn't it monstrous that some people should have five
or six votes, while you only have one?... It's foolish to say they're
'welcome to them,' like that, when they only use them to deprive you
of your rights.... Then there's Welsh Disestablishment.... Oh, if you
really can't see the immense importance of it, all I can say is, I'm
extremely sorry.... Yes, I'm going now, and I hope, before the election
day comes, you will have learnt to take a more enlightened&mdash;&mdash;<i>Good</i>
afternoon."</p>

<p>"I'm so glad to have found you at home, Mr. <span class="smcap">Bilger</span>. I'm
Mrs. <span class="smcap">Honeyball</span>, and I want you to support my husband at the
election&mdash;he's standing as a Liberal, you know.... Oh, yes, I think
I can tell you his views on the Liquor Traffic. He's anxious to see
the curse of drinking thoroughly stamped out.... No, I'm sure you're
no friend to publicans&mdash;you look <i>far</i> too respectable.... Yes, as you
say, they get rich on the earnings of the poor, and it's high time
they were done away with.... <i>Certainly</i> you may ask me a question....
No, of course my husband would not <i>dream</i> of putting down Clubs: he
belongs to several himself.... Oh, you meant <i>Working-men's</i> Clubs. You
belong to one yourself? So <i>sensible</i> of you!&mdash;and of course there can
be no possible objection, so long as no intoxicating liquor&mdash;&mdash;<i>Not</i>
conducted on Teetotal principles? I'm afraid that <i>would</i> make a
difference.... Why? Because, don't you <i>see</i>, if people can go and
join Clubs, and get drink there, there would be no use in closing the
public-houses, <i>would</i> there? We must be <i>logical</i>.... No <i>doubt</i>
intoxicating drinks are supplied in Clubs, but I don't see what <i>that</i>
has to do with it.... My husband? No, he's not a total abstainer, but
still&mdash;&mdash;... No, no; it's not a question of one law for the Rich and
another for the Poor at <i>all</i>. You don't quite <i>understand</i>.... If
you <i>really</i> have heard enough, I'll go, of course.... Not at all. If
anything I've said has helped you in making up your mind, I'm only
too&mdash;&mdash;Don't trouble to come to the door!"</p>

you want to put him in a red tunic for?... Really? The living image of
your first young man? He <i>will</i> be flattered!... You've had several

<p class="ph4">OPERATIC NOTES.</p>

<p><i>Monday</i> memorable for <span class="smcap">Melba</span>. Never sang better than as
mad-as-a-hatter heroine of <span class="smcap">Donizetti's</span> <i>Lucia di Lammermoor</i>.
Three hearty, deafening, unanimous encores for the brilliant
fireworky Hanwellian vocalisation in <span class="smcap">Lucy's</span> (not "<span class="smcap">H.
W. Lucy's</span>," of the <i>D. N.</i>, but Miss <span class="smcap">Lucia's</span>) great
<i>de lunatico inquirendo</i> scena. After encore, inevitable gigantic
basket of flowers handed up to triumphant cantatrice by Beaming
<span class="smcap">Bevignani</span> and talented assistants in orchestra. Conductor and
musicians ought not to be used as agents for delivery of bouquets to
<i>prime donne</i>. If somebody among audience wishes to publicly present
singer with floral testimonial, why not let that Somebody step forward
(as the person in church who would "forbid the banns" is invited to do)
and hand it to her himself on a stick? Or if he be in some other part
of the house, <span class="smcap">Dulcissimus Druriolanus</span> would himself introduce
him and his basket of flowers on to, and off, the stage. The encores
and the floral testimonial quite turned mad heroine's head.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 265px;">

<p>That is, so turned it round again that she became quite sane and
chatted amicably with two or three of the leading chorus "up stage"
until it suddenly occurred to her that she must go mad again, which she
did at once, most effectively. After this "<i>Fra poco</i>," the swan-like
(if swan a tenor) death-song of <i>Edgardo</i>, cannot go for its value
unless sung by a most popular and highly-gifted tenor. So it stands
to the credit of Signor <span class="smcap">Dash-my-Vignas</span> that, in this, he was
enthusiastically applauded, and soon after "laid him down and dee'd"
in the midst of an admiring and more-or-less sympathetic Chorus.
Great opera for Chorus giving expression to their feelings. How they
cry or laugh, and point and gesticulate and threaten and sympathise
as guests in low dresses without anything distinctively Scotch about
them, except in the case of one lady over whose shoulder I fancy I
detected a tartan scarf of clannish pattern. <i>Normanno</i>, played by, I
think, <span class="smcap">Iginio Corsi</span> (which name, in compliment to the national
Scotch liquor, ought to have been changed to "<span class="smcap">Iwiskio Corsi</span>"),
bore remarkable resemblance to Markis o' <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span>. I do
not remember ever having seen or heard Lord <span class="smcap">Salisbury</span> as
a vocalist. To be remembered as <i>The</i> <span class="smcap">Melba</span> Night of the
Season&mdash;up to now.</p>

<p><i>Wednesday.</i>&mdash;<span class="smcap">Calvé</span> as <i>Carmen</i> simply perfect. That is
all I have to say; like the Raven (not <i>Barnaby Rudge's</i>, but
<span class="smcap">Edgar A. Poe's</span>), I announce "Only this, and Nothing More."
And <span class="smcap">Alvarez</span> as <i>José</i>, "Gentleman <span class="smcap">Joe</span>," who does
not drive, but is driven to madness, first-rate; in last scene,
struggle and assassination most thrilling, dramatically: even
stall-by-the-season'd opera-goers holding breath, and clutching at
backs of seats. Audience, ordinarily indifferent to fate of heroine
in last act, wait till bitter end. They only quit when quite sure
<i>Carmen</i> cannot possibly sing any more. Madame <span class="smcap">Melba</span>,
who, "<i>by request of the Management</i>"&mdash;how modestly is this put,
<span class="smcap">O Druriolanus Operaticus!</span>&mdash;"<i>has kindly consented to play
Michaela</i>," exceeded the terms of her amiable contract, as she not only
"played" <i>Michaela</i>, but sang the music superbly, her singing being
faultless, which her "playing" was not. Mossoo <span class="smcap">Albers</span> rather
out of it as <i>Escamillo</i>, and <i>Toréador</i> was not an Encoreador, whereat
<i>Toréador non contento</i>. All the principals sang in French, "knowing
the language," but clever Chorus stuck to Italian. <i>Benissimo!</i>
<span class="smcap">Bevignani</span> beaming, and beating time. House crowded; elections
and political parties disturb not the harmony of Covent Garden. Yet
"last week but one" announced, and end in view. <span class="smcap">Wagstaff</span>,
seeing <span class="smcap">Calvé</span> in first act with scarf or belt round waist,
suggests riddle, "Why is <span class="smcap">Calvé</span> a perfect <i>Carmen?</i>" Before
you can break away from him, without damage to your button-hole,
he answers, "Because she plays the part with <i>a-band-on</i>." <i>Exit</i>
<span class="smcap">Wagstaff</span>.</p>

<p><i>Friday.</i>&mdash;<i>Pagliacci.</i>&mdash;A new <i>Nedda</i> in Mlle. <span class="smcap">Zélie de
Lussan</span>. <i>Nedda</i> is rather a Loose'un, and Mlle. <span class="smcap">Zélie</span>
is as good a <i>Nedda</i> as you can get "when t'other dear charmer's
away." Then to follow, <span class="smcap">Calvé</span> in <i>Calvé-'lleria Rusticana</i>
admirably dramatic. Can't believe this Magdalenish saint-like woman can
possibly be that deuce of a young woman, <i>Carmen</i>, of t'other night.
But "<i>F&oelig;mina varium et mutabile</i> (also <i>cantabile</i>) <i>semper</i>." All
the others good as ever, specially <span class="smcap">Giulia Ravogli</span>, as the gay
<i>Lo-la-li-ety</i>.</p>

<p class="ph4">SCRAPS FROM CHAPS.</p>

<p>The hedgehog is sometimes accused of helping himself to a drink from
a recumbent cow, but his larger relative, the domestic pig, is to be
even still more commended for his enterprise. According to the <i>Western
Daily Mercury</i>, in a farmyard in the parish of Uffculme a pig was
observed to rear on his hind legs and suck milk from a cow. This sight
must have enormously impressed the spectator. But it ought to have been
a dog.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>Surely a Radical Unionist is a new departure in politics. Mr.
<span class="smcap">Strauss</span>, who is opposing Mr. <span class="smcap">Conybeare</span>, M.P. for
the Camborne division of Cornwall, in reply to a question at Cusgarne
said that he was a Radical Unionist, but the name Liberal was good
enough for him. Mr. <span class="smcap">Strauss</span> is to be congratulated on his
new political "Doctrinen"; but, if he should succeed in defeating Mr.
<span class="smcap">Conybeare</span>, he seems likely to lead the Whips a pretty dance.</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p>It seems a little hard on a Parliamentary candidate when he is
seriously misrepresented by his own friends. This is what Mr.
<span class="smcap">Michael Williams</span> has suffered in the St. Austell division of
Cornwall at the hands of his friend Canon <span class="smcap">Bush</span>. With every
intention of doing Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span> a good turn, the worthy Canon
fired off a letter in the local press containing a serious misquotation
of a speech said to have been made by Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams</span> about the
false doctrines of the Nonconformists. The explosion of this shell in
the Nonconformist camp has not improved Mr. <span class="smcap">Williams's</span> chance
of success, and he probably believes in the truth of the old saying,
that "Good wine needs no Bush."</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">A Pull All Together.</span>&mdash;What our forefathers would have called
"seeking an explanation from one's representative," is now, in these
days of political slang, known as "pulling your member's leg!" Witness
what happened in West Fife:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Mr. <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> said, that if they returned him they would have
the advantage of being able to run down to <span class="smcap">Wemyss</span> when he did
anything wrong and pull his leg at the cost of a sixpence in train
money, whereas, if they wanted to pull Mr. <span class="smcap">Birrell</span> over the
coals, it would cost them £3 to go to London."</p></blockquote>

<p>The electors would certainly seem to "have the pull" by Mr.
<span class="smcap">Wemyss's</span> proximity; but why didn't some heckler retort by
saying that in pulling a candidate's leg voters must be careful not to
get hold of a calf?</p>

<hr class="short" />

<p><span class="smcap">Slow Training.</span>&mdash;The Cork County National Teachers' Association
has passed a resolution that "for the sixth class" the geography of
the British Isles is enough, and "that the British Colonies be held
over till the examination in the second year." But how will the British
Colonies like being held over? And is not Ireland itself going to be
a self-governing British Colony&mdash;some day? But that idea, too, seems
"held over" for the present. The National Teachers, however, are true
Nationalists, because they also resolved that "Professors of Irish
should be appointed in all the Training Colleges." If females, they
will be expected to wear the Celtic fringe, of course.</p>

The Cornell crew was ready and willin'. So they had the starter with

<p class="center"><i>All' illustrissimo Signor Punch.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Illustriousest Sir</span>,&mdash;I feel myself in duty of to write to
her these few lines for to tell to her the my opinion of the of her
country. Ah, the beautiful England! One speaks in Italy of the <i>cielo
inglese</i>, when the sky is grey and overcast. For the first time I come
now in the my ship to the of her country. <i>Ecco</i>, the sky is blue! In
the our country so many things are blue&mdash;the sky, the sea, the lakes,
the distant mountains, but in the our language not there is the word
"blue." One says "azure" or "turquoise," but not the general term
"blue." Therefore before I come to England I think, "We Italians see
the colour blue, but not can say it, and these english have the word,
but see never the colour." And <i>ecco</i> I arrive, and the sky is blue!
Not it is the blue of Napoli, not it is the blue of Geneva, and perhaps
it is to-day only, but <i>veramente</i> it is blue. It is much curious.</p>

<p>Also I have found other things blue. Some time the sea is pale blue.
Some time the milk is pale blue. And one english says to me, "The
sea was rough and the wind blue," but this not can I understand. The
his friends say he likes chaff. <i>Diavolo</i>, what taste! But perhaps
the chaff is much helpful for the digestion, like the english brown
bread, which some brave men eat. The his friends say also, "He chaffs
till all is blue." Perhaps when one eats the chaff the eyesight is
altered. It is much curious. There are other things blue in England.
There are "the blues." One my friend says to me that this phrase is the
french <i>ennui</i>. Then I have not it seen yet, for it is always <i>festa</i>
since our arrival. I have heard that the blues are at Oxford and at
Cambridge, above all at the College of Girton. But the evening past
I saw the blue the most beautiful. Ah, the exquisite eyes! Ah, <i>la
bellissima signorina inglese!</i> so graceful, so courteous, so beautiful!
And the her eyes were blue, so blue! Never have I seen a colour so
sweet. The sea at Napoli, the sky at Palermo, the lake at Bellagio&mdash;it
seems to me that they are grey and ugly when I think to the her eyes.</p>

<p>Ah, Signor <i>Punch</i>, Her is a man, Her can love, Her, I know it, admires
the beauty of the women! So to her I tell that those blue eyes have hit
the heart of the italian. Not in Italy, but in England, one sees the
blue the most divine.</p>

<p class="ph3">EX-HON. PRIVATE A. BRIEFLESS, JUN., ON THE I. O. C. R. V. C. AT BISLEY.</p>

<p>It is scarcely necessary to say that during the sitting of the Courts I
have little time for what may be termed recreation. So when I visited
Bisley on the occasion of the competition for the Ashburnham Shield,
it was in a semi-military and semi-forensic capacity. It was no doubt
pleasing to see one's schoolfellows of a later generation maintaining
the <i>prestige</i> of a common <i>Alma Mater</i>; but the chief attraction in
my eyes of the successor to Wimbledon was the presence under canvas of
much that is left of the "Devil's Own." And here let me pause for a
moment to discuss the traditional derivation of the alternative title
of the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteer Corps. I believe His late Majesty
King <span class="smcap">William the Fourth</span> (of marine memory) is usually believed
to have been the first to call his lawyer warriors by the name that,
to certain minds, has had since an unsympathetic significance. I am
of opinion that the Sailor Sovereign merely confirmed a title that
had already been obtained by usage. It is more than possible that the
initial supporters of the I. O. C. R. V. C. were counsel seldom holding
briefs of their own, but frequently appearing as "learned" but absent
"friends." It is needless to hint to the Bench and Bar that I refer to
"devils." If my assumption is correct, then indeed would the Battalion
be justly known to fame as "the Devil's Own."</p>

</div>


<p>I wish I could deny the reports that have found their way into the
papers that the I. O. C. R. V. C. is less prosperous than it was of
yore. Personally, I have it on my conscience that I have not for many
years appeared on parade. To the best of my belief I have only once
joined the ranks. The occasion was a prize distribution in Lincoln's
Inn Hall. As an honorary member I was posted in the front rank of "A"
Company. Then came the perplexing command, "Fours right," which, so
far as I was concerned, ended in disaster. A little later I retired
from all active military service, and have remained in retreat ever
since. Still, at the sound of the bugle my pulse quickens, and I
feel that had I chosen the Tented Field instead of the Forum for the
exercise of my professional duties my career would not have suffered
in prosperity from the alteration. In fact, I believe that with the
conditions changed I should have had just as good a chance of becoming
Commander-in-Chief as Lord Chancellor. But these are regrets that are
out of place in the columns of a periodical that guards the interests
of the universe in general, while fostering the loftiest aspirations of
the legal profession in particular. So I cast them aside as unworthy
the attention of a counsel, a soldier, and a gentleman.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span></p>
<p>Let me return to the I. O. C. R. V. C. at Bisley. I found "those of the
faithful who have been true to their trust" defending themselves&mdash;there
was no trace of defiance in the action&mdash;from the fierce fire of the
noonday sun by wearing straw hats and sporting flannels. It was a
pretty picture, that made by the martial lawyers at their mid-day
parade. The tents, the tubs, the kitchen utensils, and last, but not
least, the mess-house, with its dining saloon and ante-room. Alas, that
the stability of the latter should be inappropriate! Alas, that the
corps, once the pride of the Volunteer Service, should be reduced to
four companies, and (so I believe) have lost its adjutant! Ichabod! How
the mighty have fallen!</p>

<p>As I watched the sad and yet impressive tableau old memories flocked
upon me. Where was the private who caricatured his Colonel, and showed
how a shako could be combined with a horse-hair wig, and yet look
military and forensic? Where was the lance corporal who invariably
confirmed his captain's commands with an "as your Lordship pleases?"
Where was the rear-rank wag who, on being told to charge, said he "must
leave that sort of thing to his clerk, who kept his fee-book?" Where
was the vocalist who would sing the songs of <span class="smcap">J. L. Molloy</span>,
Barrister-at-Law, and knew the ins and outs of "The Maske of Flowers?"
All of them gone, and their places scarcely filled by new comers!
And, as I gazed upon an energetic private of the I. O. C. R. V. C.,
apparently preparing to meet the demands of an expected detachment of
hungry lunchers, I wondered whether anything could be done to revive
the fortunes of the Grand Old Battalion. Could the hours of leisure of
the warriors be occupied by regimental trips down the river, regimental
drags to the races, regimental dinners to one another, regimental
visits to the play, regimental strolls in the Row, regimental bicycles
in Battersea Park? I fancy something of this kind has already been
suggested. Then, if Barristers do not flock in sufficient numbers to
the banners of the Lamb, the Horse, and the Griffin, why not throw
open the ranks to wealthy persons&mdash;so to speak&mdash;fond of the leaders
of litigation? Again I imagine some such plan has already been under
consideration.</p>

<p>And, as I thought the matter over, I became gloomier and gloomier. So
sad was I that I had to visit the adjacent cemetery, to revive, under
the modified merriment of the place, into comparative cheerfulness. The
mere recollection of the I. O. C. R. V. C. unmans me. It is better that
I should pause, for I can write no more.</p>

<p class="ph4">THE CRY OF THE COUNTER.</p>

<p class="center">(<i>By a Shopkeeper who had hoped better things of the Season.</i>)</p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Great Scott! Sold again! It's all up with the Season,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Though Summer <i>is</i> Summer, and Goodwood's not gone!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">We Shopkeepers hoped for good luck, and with reason,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">For things did look bright. But once more we are done;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Done, clean as a whistle! A General Election!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Sprung on us, through <span class="smcap">Brodrick</span>, and cordite, and stuff!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A plague on both parties, a curse on each section!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Your M.P.'s a mooncalf, a muddler, a muff!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The weather was stunning; Death had not been busy</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With Royalties&mdash;bless 'em!&mdash;and London was full;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And though of course <span class="smcap">Rosebery</span> is not a <span class="smcap">Dizzy</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He <i>did</i> win the Derby, which gave him some pull.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Parties kept wrangling,&mdash;but nobody bothered;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They didn't make progress,&mdash;but none of us cared;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Though <span class="smcap">Labby</span> played tricks, or <span class="smcap">Silom</span> o pothered,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We stuck to our counters, unshocked and unscared.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And now, betwixt grass-time and harvest, the duffers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Fight over sheer fudge and kick over the show.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And so once again the poor Shopkeeper suffers.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">A murrain on <span class="smcap">Harcourt</span>, a plague upon <span class="smcap">Joe</span>!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For policy <span class="smcap">Balfour</span> sets forth "Dissolution,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And thinks he has scored. Had I temper, and breath,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;"><i>And</i> his ear, I could smash up his smart elocution,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;"><i>His</i> game's Dissolution,&mdash;to us it means death.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The fat's in the fire, and the spark's in the powder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">We're in for a long spell of wigs on the green.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Our clients will scatter, and louder and louder</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Will swell the fool-chorus of partisan spleen.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Sir <span class="smcap">Bottleby Snipe</span> must be off beyond Humber,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And sweet Lady <span class="smcap">Spendwell</span> goes Primrosing, south,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And I, poor shopkeeper, may just as well slumber,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With rage in my heart and my thumb in my mouth.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Oh, slaves of the shop, from Pall Mall to far Peckham,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Say, is it not time that <i>you</i> rose and rebelled?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The parties just play with us. Can we not check 'em?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">By Jove, if one chorus of shopdom but swelled,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Like the working man's howl, on those Westminster wobblers,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The sweet little game they all play it might stop.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">For Socialist dockers and Radical cobblers</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">They've ears; but they're deaf to the Cry of the Shop.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The rents, rates and taxes pile higher and higher,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">The Stores undersell us&mdash;and cop ready cash!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The Hebrew monopolist, fiercer and slyer</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Than tiger-cat, schemeth to send us to smash.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The landlord rack-rents us, and then pops the profit</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">He draws out of us into syndicate Stores!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">I tell you the shopkeeper's life is a Tophet,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">M.P.'s play at "Progress," and <i>we</i> pay all scores.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And then they ask me for my vote!!! Why, what guerdon</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Have I for my votings these twenty years past?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Continual addition to back-breaking burden!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">I say the last straw has been laid on, at last;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At least upon this individual camel.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">To forward true Progress I don't think I'm loth,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But sick of prolonged Party trick, trap, and trammel,</span><br />

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Air</span>&mdash;"<i>The Norrible Tale.</i>"</p>


<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">'Tis a norrible tale I'm going to tell</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of the frightful fortunes which befel</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">A family who late resided</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In the same suburban street that I did.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O it is a norrible tale!</span><br />

<span style="margin-left: 2em;">With its frightful blend of the grim and glum,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Of fiddle-de-dee, and fi-fo-fum!</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">O they were a decent Philistine lot</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till they caught the contagion of "Tommy-Rot,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">That kind of mental, malarial fever,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which floors the foolish and foils the clever.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O it is a norrible tale, &amp;c.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">This Influenza of the Soul</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Haunted their house like some gruesome "troll."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(The family&mdash;which their name was <span class="smcap">Gibson</span>&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Knew all about such from the works of <span class="smcap">Ibsen</span>.)</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The father first felt the spell unholy,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And the man's demeanour grew truly "trolly."</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He was&mdash;in Peckham&mdash;a Master Builder,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And he "carried on" with a drudge named <span class="smcap">'Tilder</span>.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The slavey said it was truly thrilling,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But struck for another&mdash;weekly&mdash;shilling.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"She was ready to thrill till all was blue,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">But it <i>must</i> be reckenised in her 'screw!'"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">His wife declared he was most inhuman,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And, for her part, she should turn New Woman!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">So she grew&mdash;to him&mdash;an emotional icicle,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And mounted knickers, and rode a bicycle.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eldest son, an athletic young fellow,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Who had gained his "Blue," took at once to Yellow.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Muscle," he said, in a tone despotic,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Is beastly vulgaw; good form's Neurotic!"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The youngest daughter, a blue-eyed fairy&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">(Her pies were prime, and her name was <span class="smcap">Mary</span>&mdash;)</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Now took to cricket, and cigarette-smoking,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And manly manners in togs&mdash;and joking.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eldest one, of a statelier carriage,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Conceived quaint notions about "Group-marriage:"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Since man's a satyr, and brings satiety,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The only virtue is&mdash;in <i>variety!</i>"</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Another girl took to writing novels</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">On dirt in "dosses," and vice in hovels;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Varying the same with Kiplingy verses,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">With ingenious rhymes to street-slang and curses.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The youngest boy, who was "only a nipper,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Contributed "Art" to the "Sixpenny Snipper,"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Which his sisters said was "supremely delicious,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">As a blend of the infantile and vicious."</span><br /><br /><br />
</p>



<p><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The father died of his drudge and drink,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The wife broke her back at a skating rink;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">And as to the slavey, whose name was <span class="smcap">'TILDER</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">She "thrilled"&mdash;on street-preaching and rum&mdash;till they killed her.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eldest son read <span class="smcap">Nordau</span> and <span class="smcap">Lombroso</span>,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Till his brain went shaky&mdash;'twas always so-so&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">He imagines himself a pot of mustard,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Of which egomaniacs are making a custard.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The youngest daughter's an "Amazon Queen"</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">At the East-end Halls, and she's loud and lean;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The eldest&mdash;whose freedom all bonds would sully&mdash;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Is tied to&mdash;and thrashed by&mdash;a pugilist bully.</span><br />
<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The writer of sensuous snippety novels,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">In Grub Street gutters forlornly grovels;</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">The "Boy Genius of Gehenna," of the babbling boasters,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">Turns a very poor penny by Stygian Posters!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">O it <i>is</i> a norrible tale!</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">And what do New Women and New Art avail?</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">Egomania-Tommyrotica is all a hum,</span><br />

<p class="ph3">ELECTION INTELLIGENCE.</p>

<p class="center">TOBY ONCE MORE M.P.</p>

<p>On Monday the Electors of Barkshire assembled in the great hall
of their county town to elect a Member to serve in the Fourteenth
Parliament of Queen <span class="smcap">Victoria</span>. The High Sheriff presided.
Owing to the constitutional rule which forbids Peers to take part
in Parliamentary electoral proceedings, the Lord Lieutenant of the
county was precluded from showing himself on the platform. It was said
that, indisposed to be entirely out of so interesting and popular
an event, his lordship was present disguised as a tide-waiter. Our
representative, however, did not observe in the throng any person in
nautical dress.</p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 393px;">
<a href="images/036full.jpg">

<img src="images/036.jpg" width="393" height="450" alt="&quot;Carried unanimously.&quot;" /></a>
<p class="center">"Carried unanimously."</p>

</div>

<p>The hall, which was crowded to its utmost capacity, was gaily decorated
with flags. Across the full length of the hall was suspended a banner
bearing the proud device "<span class="smcap">Barks's is willin'</span>."</p>

<p>Our esteemed ex-Member was accompanied on the platform by the principal
county gentry of all shades of political opinion. On taking his seat in
the front row of chairs, he was received with rounds of Kentish fire,
made in Barkshire. Having been proposed and seconded in eulogistic
terms, report of which he has expressed a desire we should suppress,
the High Sheriff inquired if any elector desired to propose another
candidate?</p>

<p>"I should think not," said a burly Barkshire farmer, ominously grasping
a stout blackthorn.</p>

<p>After this no one seemed disposed to move, and the High Sheriff
declared <span class="smcap">Toby</span>, M.P., duly elected. There were loud cries for
the Member, who, overcoming natural and usually insuperable diffidence,
got on his hind legs.</p>

<p>"Brother electors," he said, "it is an old saying, 'What Barkshire
thinks to-day, England will do to-morrow.' Obviously some inaccuracy
underlies the aphorism, since whilst you have to-day thought me
worthy of being elected your Member, it's no use England coming
round to-morrow and asking me to represent it in the Commons House
of Parliament. This is the fourth time Barkshire has done me this
honour; and base indeed is the man&mdash;(<i>A Voice, 'Who pays'</i>)&mdash;who could
be insensible to such testimony of confidence and esteem. Brother
electors&mdash;(<i>A Voice, 'Who stole the Emperor William's uniform?'
Disturbance at the end of the hall. Another Voice, 'Chuck him out.'</i>)
No, electors of Barkshire, let him stay. If he is put outside, he
loses the opportunity of observing your behaviour, and learning how
gentlemen comport themselves when publicly assembled in discharge of
a solemn duty. (<i>Loud cheers. A Voice, 'That fetches 'em!'</i>) I was
about to observe, when our friend's feelings temporarily overcame him,
that since I entered the room I have had a number of questions handed
up to me. They are a little late, since I am no longer a candidate
but am duly elected. That, however unusual the case may be, makes no
difference. The first question is: 'Will you, if elected, see that
every man in Barkshire over fifty years of age has three acres of
the best land in the parish, with a cow for every adult child and a
calf a-piece for each infant in arms?' Certainly; I hope I may live
to see established those desirable conditions as between man and man.
(<i>Cheers.</i>) Another esteemed friend asks: 'Do you understand Local Veto
to mean that a man may go into the public-house, take his noggin or
what not, and when asked to pay may refuse?' I could not if I tried put
my views on the situation more clearly. The Veto, as you all know, is
a Latin word meaning to <i>vete</i>, or, as we say in English, to refuse to
stump up. A public-house is, according to 19 Vict. c. 190, a locality.
Local Veto is, therefore, the inalienable right of the English citizen
as defined by my friend. (<i>Loud cheers.</i>) 'Are you in favour of
Equalisation of the Rates?' To be frank with you, my idea of rates is
that they should be equalised to the extent that makes them absolutely
impalpable. (<i>'No, no.' 'Yes, yes.' Uproar under the gallery. Cries
of</i> '<span class="smcap">Judas!</span>' <i>A free fight, during which a man was ejected,
omitting to take his coat with him.</i>) Don't put him out; don't put
anyone out. If there's a renewal of the interruption, form a ring round
the man; then we will see where we are. Here's another question: 'Do
you approve of Ice Creams made in foreign prisons smuggled over here in
barrel-organs and ground out in our streets, ruining the digestion of
our working men?' That is a question which hardly seems to need reply
from a patriotic Englishman. But I will say&mdash;and you observe I say it
emphatically&mdash;No. (<i>Loud cheering.</i>) 'Are you in favour of a Second
Chamber, or do you go the length of Tenification?' That is a very nice
question. It shows how deeply and intelligently the men of Barkshire
study the questions of the day. It is not a matter on which I, for one,
care to dogmatize; I will therefore content myself with saying, that
between two and ten we might find the happy medium. (<i>More cheering,
the audience rising to their feet, waving hats and handkerchiefs.</i>)
Now, gentlemen, that's all the questions I have, and I hope you'll
agree that I have answered them frankly. Ah! here's another one coming
up. (<i>A dirty piece of paper is passed from hand to hand till it
reached the hon. Member.</i>) 'Could you lend me five bob till Saturday
night?' (<i>Laughter, in which the hon. Member heartily joined.</i>) I
think, gentlemen, it is time we now proposed a vote of thanks to the
High Sheriff." (<i>This was carried unanimously, and the meeting broke
up. A torch-light procession conducted the popular member to his family
seat, The Kennel, Barks.</i>)</p>

<p class="ph4">A LITERARY TURN.</p>

<p>There was a case in the Edinburgh Court of Session the other day,
which shows what is thought of authors north of the Tweed&mdash;and not by
publishers, either. A witness remarked of a "defender" that "he was of
a literary turn of mind, and he thought that spoiled him." Many persons
have had similar thoughts, but they have generally refrained from
uttering them quite so bluntly.</p>

the giver of the entertainment who, having requested wire informing
him whether Herr <span class="smcap">Iff</span> and his band could come, should receive
this reply: "<i>If can come will be there at hour stated.</i>" This supposes
that some well-informed, grammatical, telegraphic young lady-clerk has
corrected the spelling of "<span class="smcap">Iff</span>." <i>À propos</i> of <span class="smcap">Iff</span>, a
complete entertainment would be a recital by the Veteran <span class="smcap">Howe</span>
